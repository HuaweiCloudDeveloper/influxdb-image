## Repository Introduction

[InfluxDB](https://github.com/InfluxData/InfluxDB) is an open-source time series database developed by InfluxData, designed for efficient storage and real-time analysis of time series data. This product provides a ready-to-use InfluxDB based on the Huawei Cloud EulerOS 2.0 64-bit system on Kunpeng servers.

## Core Features

- **High-performance Time Series Processing**: Optimized for high-frequency writes and fast queries, it supports processing millions of data points per second and uses the TSM engine to improve storage efficiency.
- **Nanosecond-level Time Precision**: Supports high-precision timestamps (nanosecond level) to ensure accurate storage and query of data in chronological order.
- **Optimized Data Model**: Organizes data through tags and fields, supporting flexible real-time analysis functions (such as continuous queries and stream processing).
